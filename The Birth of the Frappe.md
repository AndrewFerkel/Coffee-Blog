# The Birth of the Frappucino

# Where did it come from?

Perhaps the most iconic coffee variation in America was created by Starbucks in the summer of 1994. The name, originally coined by a bought-out business called The Coffee Connection, loosely means coffee shake. And, as Dina Campion and other Starbucks' employees spearheaded this incentive, the name became associated with coffee blended with ice. Very quickly, the product's popularity grew.

“The first week of launch we were tracking sales, and it was something like 200,000 drinks the first week – when we were hoping for 100,000,” Moore said. “The next week it was 400,000 and the next it was 800,000. We had figured it would do well in Southern California – but it sold just as well in Chicago, Vancouver B.C. and Boston. It was huge.”

# How did it become so popular?

In hindsight, the innocative product truly sped the growth of Starbucks and, with it, a dynamic, American coffee market. In twenty short years, the product escaladed from two flavor options to 36,000 options that are available in sixty-six countries. Still, the influence affected America the most, further isolating the coffee culture of the United States from other countries. Now, people purchases frappucinos readily in bottles at gas stations and at coffee shops. Grocery stores have implemented small Starbucks inside of their buildings to further entice customers. 

Almost single-handedly, Starbucks has standardized drinking sugary frappucinos and other gourmet styles of coffee rather than plain, black coffee. Whereas it used to be the case that people would wake up their morning with a cup of folgers with some milk and maybe sugar, now they find their way through the Starbucks drivethrough on their way to work. Though Starbucks has exceeded the number of McDonalds worldwide, some countries such as Guatemala are both too impoverished and traditionalist to fully adapt to the change. Until they do, this restaurant and the frappucino will act as the cause of a large distinction between American and Guatemalan coffee.

# What if?

Hypothetically, it is interesting to ponder how coffee would be in America if Dina Campion and her associaties had never undergone the creation of this innovative productive. Would American coffee have become such a popular drink without its cold counterpart? Since Starbucks was the first to successfully commercialize the coffee shop atmosphere, without the frappucino to jumpstart the business, America may still have regarded coffee with the same traditional approach to the drink.
