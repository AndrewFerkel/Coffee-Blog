# The Birth of the Frappucino

# Origin
Perhaps the most iconic coffee variation in America was created by Starbucks in the summer of 1994. The name, originally coined by a bought-out business called The Coffee Connection, loosely means coffee shake. And, as Dina Campion and other Starbucks' employees spearheaded this incentive, the name became associated with coffee blended with ice. 

# Impact

In hindsight, the innocative product truly sped the growth of Starbucks and, with it, a dynamic, American coffee market. In twenty short years, the product escaladed from two flavor options to 36,000 options that are available in sixty-six countries. Still, the influence affected America the most, further isolating the coffee culture of the United States from other countries. Now, people purchases frappucinos readily in bottles at gas stations and at coffee shops. Grocery stores have implemented small Starbucks inside of their buildings to further entice customers. 

Almost single-handedly, Starbucks has standardized drinking sugary frappucinos and other gourmet styles of coffee rather than plain, black coffee. Whereas it used to be the case that people would wake up their morning with a cup of folgers with some milk and maybe sugar, now they find their way through the Starbucks drivethrough on their way to work. Though starbucks has exceeded the number of McDonalds worldwide, some countries such as Guatemala are both too impoverished and traditionalist to fully adapt to the change. Until they do, this restaurant and the frappucino will act as the cause of a large distinction between American and Guatemalan coffee.
