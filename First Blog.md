# Greetings,

My name is Andrew Ferkel, and I've been examing coffee, the preparation of the drink and the growth of grounds, for almost as long as I can remember. Ever since I took a trip to Guatemala a few years ago, I have become more passionate about the way that coffee is affected by the location it is being served, especially on an international level. 

As one of their largest products, Guatemala exports 330 million worth of coffee to the United States each year. As a result, there is a very close link to the coffee in America and that of Guatemala. However, even in this product, the American market has commercialized the drink in a way that Guatemala simply has not. I plan to investigate some of the implications of this relationship as well as the similarities and differences between the the drink in both countries. 

In many ways, coffee can act as a lense from which people can examine various cultures, and these two countries are not an exception. New developments, such as the frappucino highlight how Americans often add elements to their drink until it has been fundamentally changed. In a culture that is incessent upon having everything, it should not come as a surprise that a highly-specialized drink follows this trend. Guatemala, an impoverished country, enriched in tradition, reflects these two traits in their simplistic regard for coffee. Often times, they have a higher regard for the specific flavors, rather than the sweetness. Understand, I am discussing the reflection of the countries as a whole and how they compare to one another. While exceptions exist, these guidelines help to explain much of how the drink has evolved in both settings.

Indeed, I am very excited to share this journey with all of you and to learn more about coffee and cultures. So, if you love the rich result of mixing beans and water, if you are interested in understanding how coffee differs between cultures, or if you wish to learn what to expect when drinking the beverage in new places, this site is for you. 

Enjoy!
