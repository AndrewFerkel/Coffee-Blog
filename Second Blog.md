# Capitalism and Coffee
America's understanding of coffee is deeply influenced by the demand for imported beans and the perception of coffee as a specialty drink.

## Price and Place 
In the United States, *good* coffee is coffee that costs five dollars. Although, it is painful to admit, many buyers, if offered the same drink for two dollars and for five dollars would assume that the more expensive one was better. There is a perception that the quality of coffee is directly linked to the price. Often times, people receive the quality for which they pay. However, just because the quality often times affects the price, does not mean the price will always affect the quality. And yet, the American demographic for coffee largely ignores this distinction and allows the price to remain far above the manufacturing cost.

In addition, coffee shops flourish because people pay expensive prices for not only the drink, but the atmosphere of the institution. They appreciate the opportunity to see their cofee made in front of them, to witness the process firsthand in a room that bears the smell of coffee. Coffee shops in America are simply a location for work to be done and friends to meet, where coffee *happens* to be offered. Whether it is the price or place, coffee drinkers can witness the effects of the free market on coffee. Every development in the culture of the drink has been influenced by the money involved.
