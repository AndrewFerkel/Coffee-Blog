# How did it start?

Similar to the United States of America, coffee is an intergral part of the economy of Guatemala. Although, rather than being a service industry, it is primarily a manufacturing industry in the country below the border. As one of the top producers for the caffienated drink, Guatemala started producing large portions of coffee in the 1860s. Anacafe, a coffee union, helps to improve the working conditions for the 125,000 producers in that extensive industry. Since the drink became an active contributor to their economy, coffee has come to account for forty percent of the agricultural exports.

Farmers in Antigua, the most-common of the seven coffee-producing regions, use the volcanic soil to their advantage by growing the beans in the mountainous areas. Even in the high altitudes, Guatemala still is abundandtly humid and has long rain seasons, allowing the coffee to grow easily in the country.

# How does it taste?

Aside from the history and science of the drink in Guatemala, there are certain, flavoral trends that visitors come to expect when they order a cup of the steaming beverage. Guatemalan coffee has a sweet, medium-roast flavor accompanied with nutty accents. With mediocre acidity, Guatemalan coffee is widely appreciated my many differently-opionated people. In some of the other areas besides Antigua, the coffee becomes even weaker but is still very good. 

If ever someone manages to travel there, they should expect a very solid, middle-of-the-ground coffee. 

# Guatemala City
 
As the capital of Guatemala, Guatemala City maintains a large amount of coffee shops, though they are seldom chains like Starbucks. Below I added a list of the top ten recommended by Trip Advisor. Many of these I have had the opportunity to personally try, and they are well worth the stop.

* Saint Honore
* San Martin
* Cafe Paradigma
* El Injerto Cafe
* Roque Rosito Cafe Gourmet
* Le Cafe (the most creative of the names...)
* Cafe Despierto
* Cafe Casa (aptly named since it translates to coffee house)
* Cafe Divino Guatemala
* Cafe Barista
