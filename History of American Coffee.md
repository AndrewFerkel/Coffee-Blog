To truly understand the differences between American and Guatemalan coffee, it is helpful to examine the past. 

America got its first real taste of coffee in the Mid-18th Century, ironically when the colonists were boycotting British tea. As the colonies began to import the beverage from Denmark, the revolution led to the first real market developments for the drink. Throughout the Ninteenth and Twentieth Century, coffee progressed as a grass roots movement, being marketed to cowboys in the midwest and early-risers in the new, growing cities. 

"By the 18th century, coffee had become one of the worldâ€™s most profitable commodities. Consumption and popularity in the US increased, especially during the Civil War, and savvy businessmen were looking for a way to profit from it."

Finally, everything changed when a small coffee shop opened in Seattle in 1971 under the name Starbucks. Overnight the market changed from a steadily growing industry to an exponentially large market. The new business made the drink accessible for most everyone and helped to solidify the presence of coffee as a regular product in the American economy. More on this subject can be found in the post, *The Birth of the Frappucino. 

Today, coffee beans are primarily imported to the States from southern countries, such as Guatemala. However, Hawaii does supply nine million pounds worth of coffee each year, most of which supplies the United States. However, a great deal of the approximate 800 farms also export their product to other countries. Furthermore, Californian farmers are catching on to the massive industry by growing the coffee plants in the shade of their avocado trees. When the product has a demand for 12 billion pounds of coffee and South American mountain farms frequently face droughts and famine, stateside farmers see the opportunity to earn an additional revenue. 

As coffee-drinkers, we will see how this business continues to progress and if this trend continues to grow in western farms. If it does continue to grow, it could cause a decrease in price for the purchasing of the grounds. However, since coffee is a frivolous product, it is unlikely that a price change will be present in the consumer market or only the manufacturer market.
